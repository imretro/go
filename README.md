## Formats

### 1-Bit Mode

This mode has only two colors: "off" and "on".
The default palette is for "off" to be black and "on" to be white, like you
might expect from a Pong console.

### 2-Bit Mode

Black, white, and two shades of gray.

### 8-Bit Mode

256 colors. Inspired by the NES, the default palette only has
54 colors, with the remaining unused colors all mapping to black.
The palette can be viewed [here][NES palette].
